# This is a plain text file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore, meaning they wont be tracked or added to your repository online when you push.
# This helps keep your repo clean and prevents accidentally sharing things you don't want to. 

# To ignore a specific file             --> file_name.txt
# To ignore all files of a type         --> *.log  *.xlsv
# To ignore a folder                    --> folder_name/
# To ignore everything except one file  --> *.txt 
# To include a specific file            --> !important.txt  (tracks this file even though all .txt are ignored)
